1. ENSURE that you have all the dependencies installed (also: ayaw mag run pag naka virtual env yung interpreter)
2. PLACE ALL the student faces on the ATTENDANCE Directory
    Each Student SHOULD have their own individual folders named accordingly (LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME)
3. RUN the app.py from the app directory
4. DO NOT RENAME files that was generated by the system (screengrabs, reports) (could cause errors)
5. DO NOT MOVE files that was generated by the system (screengrabs, reports) (could cause errors)
6. ZIP FILES ONLY when uploading student images
7. ENSURE that the student list is complete in the uploads folder before running the generate.py (report generation is limited to
   to the names found in the folder, thus, added students after running the file won't be included to the report)
8. Happy Developing my prends
(To non dev people reading this, happy day din to you :>)
